I worked as a recruitment consultant for 2.5 years but after covid I found that the market had been severly affected. As a result I decided to persue my MSc in Computer Science at Uni of York. During my studies I realised I wanted more hands on experience of coding project and in particular data engineering projects, so I joined AI Core in 2022 and completed their Data Engineering projects.

I now have a strong understanding of the data engineering life cycle and a passion for delivering high-quality, well-designed pipelines. I have experienced a variety of programming languages, including Python. I have also worked  and Java with ETL tools such as Apache Spark, Selenium, Apache Kafka and docker.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creative problem-solving and attention to detail, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. I am a motivated and collaborative team player who is dedicated to delivering outstanding results on every project I work on.
