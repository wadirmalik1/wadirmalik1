Hi there, I'm Wadir ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± Graduated with MSc in Computer Science from University of York 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Data Engineer at Xander Talent
ðŸ¥… 2023 Goals: Maximise my learning, contribute to new projects
âš¡ Fun facts: I enjoy going to the gym, playing football and watrching anime

After being made redundant from my previous job I thought it was time for a change and to do something I'm passionate about. After 3 months of self-study I joined Makers Academy to improve my coding and to learn new skills and languages to make me a desirable candidate for my future employer. As of September 2022 I started my journey as a Software Engineer.

I now have a strong understanding of the software development life cycle and a passion for delivering high-quality, well-designed products. I have experienced a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript and Ruby. I have also worked with web development frameworks such as Django, React and Ruby on Rails.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creative problem-solving and attention to detail, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. I am a motivated and collaborative team player who is dedicated to delivering outstanding results on every project I work on.
